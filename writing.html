                        <p>The Chronologist is my first novel. There is a lot I would change, but I am proud to have even finished a novel in the first place. I would spend time on further amendments were I not already in the middle of writing my second novel, Heru.</p>
                        <p><u>Synopsis</u></p>
                        <p>A retired military man, Xavion Kane, is searching for reason in a conflicted world of war and prosperity. He hopes to find it on the habitable moon of Theia, a currently unexplored potential that offers Xavion an existential renaissance. When the Federation announces its first explorative mission to the cellestial body, Xavion is the first to sign up.</p>
                        <p>But when the mission encorporates the first use of a revolutionary piece of technology, one that has the potential to finally win the ever-raging war, it brings with it the destruction of the linear timeline and a perpetual time loop.</p>
                        <p>Xavion and his team are inadvertently taken back in time to a pivotal point of humanity's revival. Can Xavion save the universe from perpetually repeating itself as well as spark a revival of his own?</p>

                            <p>Heru, my second novel, is currently in progress, at 70,000 words into its first draft (of an estimated 110,000 words). I have addressed many needed improvements in writing style, story telling and character development for this novel.</p>
                            <p><u>Synopsis</u></p>
                            <p>On the desert planet of Heru, the Spirits will help any of those who call for their assisstance. Junka, a rogue orphan child, begins his life's journey with frequent trips to the Temple for punishment. It is not long, however, until he submits himself to learn the way of the Spirits and becomes a resisdent and student of the Temple.</p>
                            <p>Two siblings, Ekkir and Floke, accept their new fate as orphans and resolve to take their own paths to redeem what has been taken from them. Floke turns to the Temple, whilst Ekkir vows to follow in his Father's footsteps and become Warden of the great city of Mutasaih.</p>
                            <p>When an unknown conjurer casts Spells of an ancient origin, the followers of the Spirits hunt for the powerful Spiritualist. Junka learns of his dead mother's history and how her lost life still impacts the events that are unfolding around him.</p>
                            <p>Meanwhile, visitors from the planet Earth bring a storm of their own, as questions of humanity's origin begin to arise. What are the Spirits, and why do they keep telling us <i>Do Not Trust the Earthmen</i>?</p>
