                    <div class="x-music-tile_content">
                        <p>It's part of my any 2018 goals to finish an 11/12 track album of relatively-polished-yet-still-scruffy demo recordings.</p>
                        <p>The album has been in the works since early 2017, and with only two or three tracks more to record and time being the only limiting factor, I anticipate the recordings to be finished by the middle of year. After that it'll need proepr mixing, mastering and perhaps a bit of fine tuning.</p>
                        <p>Here is the playlist of <i>demos of the demos</i> that have been recorded so far. As you will hear, they vary in quality depending on how recently I recorded them (they are not in chronological order, and I've learned a lot about audio engineering along the way).

                        <div class="x-music-tile_content">
                            <p>I've recently starting creating a retro shynthwave-ish Sci-Fi concept movie score. It's a mixture of old and new: the first track (which is a collection of three shorts) is new, and made for the purpose of the score, whilst the other tracks are previous songs I have made which fit in nicely with the concept.</p>
                            <p>This is a new project, so there will be more to come!</p>
